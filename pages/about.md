The Networking and Security Research (NSR) Group at the the University of Colorado is researching all things having to do with the networked systems of modern and future infrastructures. We look at the security, reliability, performance, etc. of networked infrastructures such as data centers, enterprises, and even smart grids -- basically anything with a communication network.  Our team has published in conferences such as SIGCOMM, NSDI, CoNEXT, ANCS, Usenix Security, CCS, Infocom, ISCA, and others.  

Prof. Keller holds appointments in the ECEE and CS departments, so can advise students in either. Prof. Wustrow holds appointments in the ECEE and CS departments, so can advise students in either.  Prof. Ha holds appointments in ITP and CS, and can advise students in either.

The group is a great group of students who work together and regularly get together on the weekends.  The group is entrepreneurial as well, with both Prof. Ha and Prof. Keller starting companies in the past few years.

The University of Colorado is located in Boulder, Colorado, which is a vibrant town often mentioned toward the top in "best places to live" rankings. Nearby Denver provides all of the amenities of a major city (such as a major airport), and the outdoors, with the mountains nearby, provide plenty of opportunities for play.  Boulder is driven by a high tech industry, and is the home to Tech Stars and a burgeoning startup community.

We are seeking great students at all levels to work with us.  If you are interested, contact either Prof. Keller, Prof. Ha, or Prof. Wustrow.  

**Potential PhD students**: Between Prof. Wustrow, Prof. Ha, and Prof. Keller, we will likely bring aboard  1 to 4 new PhD students each year, for the forseeable future.  We are particularly looking for strong systems students who are interested in any of our research areas.  Prior research experience is great to see, though not essential.  If you have industry experience, that can be a great asset.  Let us know what your experience is.  

**Current MS students**: If you are already at the Univ. of Colorado, the best way to start working with us is to take a class with us.  That gives you a chance to work with us and get to know each other.  If we're not offering a class you can take, feel free to reach out and we can set up a time to chat.

**Current BS students**:  We really enjoy working with undergraduate students, and there are many opportunities at the Univ. of Colorado, such as the Discovery Learning Apprenticeship.  Even outside of those programs, doing undergraduate research is a great opportunity to see whether research is for you.  Contact us to chat sometime.
