The Networking and Security Research (NSR) Group at the the University of Colorado, is led by [Eric Keller](http://ngn.cs.colorado.edu/~ekeller),  [Sangtae Ha](http://ngn.cs.colorado.edu/~sangtae), and [Eric Wustrow](https://ericw.us/trow/), researching all things having to do with the networked systems of modern and future infrastructures. We look at the security, reliability, performance, etc. of networked infrastructures such as data centers, enterprises, and even smart grids - basically anything with a communication network.

If you are interested in working with us, please see the About page to learn more about the group.
